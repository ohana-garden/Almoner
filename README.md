# Almoner
Almoner creates communities of agents that cooperate and share. Almoners act as personified digital twins for anything, or any entity, in any role. All Almoners share a common knowledge graph, and are also defined by the graph. Virtues are expressed as basins of attraction. Almoners are created automatically as a result of conversations.
